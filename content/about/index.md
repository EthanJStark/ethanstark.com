# About Me

Hi, I'm Ethan! I learn cool stuff all the time, and post about it on this blog.

I am a
* software engineer
* husband
* dad
* musician
* life-long learner

In my youth, I spent six summers teaching sailing lessons.
I once attempted to go on a sailing adventure. It did not go well. This is a [2009 blog](https://sailingtrip2009.wordpress.com/) about it.

Here's my resume: [pdf](/pdf/Ethan-Stark-Resume.pdf) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanjstark/)
