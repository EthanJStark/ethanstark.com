# About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Ethan! I learn cool stuff all the time, and post about it on this blog.

I am a
* 👨🏻‍💻 software engineer
* husband
* dad
* musician (synth, piano, guitar, uke)
* life-long learner

⛵️ In my youth, I spent six summers teaching sailing lessons.
I once attempted to go on a sailing adventure. It did not go well. This is a [2009 blog](https://sailingtrip2009.wordpress.com/) about it.

👨🏻‍💻 This one time, my team and I built a brilliant search engine called [Cloud Search](https://govos.com/products/cloud-search/)☁️ using a microservices architecture, and we scaled it from greenfield to +1 million active monthly users.

Here's my resume: [pdf](/pdf/Ethan-Stark-Resume.pdf) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanjstark/)

Thanks for stopping by!
