# About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Ethan! I learn cool stuff all the time, and write about it on this blog.

I am a
* 👨🏻‍💻 software engineer
* husband
* dad
* musician (synth, piano, guitar, uke)
* life-long learner

👨🏻‍💻 This one time, my team and I built a brilliant search engine called [Cloud Search](https://govos.com/products/cloud-search/)☁️ using a microservices architecture, and we scaled it from greenfield to +1 million active monthly users.

🐘 Here's my Mastodon profile: [@ethanjstark@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@ethanjstark)

📄 Here's my resume: [pdf](/pdf/Ethan-Stark-Resume.pdf) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanjstark/)
