If you're not yet familiar with Project 2025, please read up on it, or you will be learning about it in real time as it's implemented. Visiting family for the 4th? Please talk to them about it.

#### A few policy highlights:

- Place entire federal bureaucracy, including DOJ, under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”.
- eliminate job protections for thousands of government employees, who would then be replaced by political appointees.
- eliminate the Department of Education 🤯 

Look, I got you an accessible, humorous breakdown of what’s included!

Here’s [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://youtu.be/gYwqpx6lp_s).

This is not a hypothetical: Project 2025 has a $22M budget and has been recruiting folk and gathering a database of loyalists who can fill both partisan and nonpartisan government roles; this effort has been going on since the 2023 Iowa State Fair.

### Who Is Behind This 
Notable authors of the project's Mandate for Leadership include many officials and advisors from the Trump administration including Jonathan Berry, Ben Carson, Ken Cuccinelli, Rick Dearborn, Thomas Gilman, Mandy Gunasekara, Gene Hamilton, Christopher Miller, Bernard McNamee, Stephen Moore, Mora Namdar, Peter Navarro, William Perry Pendley, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Kiron Skinner, Roger Severino, Hans von Spakovsky, Brooks Tucker, Russell Vought, and Paul Winfree.

These are folk who were employed by Trump’s administration, and some of them will absolutely be part of a future administration.

Or, dive into the source material yourself [PDF](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)! It’s the saddest game of roulette—just pick a page from “Mandate for Leadership”

“Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained, and prepared conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State.”
