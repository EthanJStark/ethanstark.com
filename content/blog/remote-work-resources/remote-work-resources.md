I started writing a friend to share some favorite resources for remote software engineering work, and remembered something I read and appreciated: _If you're writing something that might have utility for more than one person, consider making it a blog post._

Here it is! What did I miss? [Hit me up!](ethanstark.com/about/)

# [Hired.com](https://hired.com/x/a3eddbe0097a33ac026d108f69e6a8da)
If you sign up with that link and get hired, I get some 💵.

How it works: You sign up. If you're accepted, your profile / resume is shown to internal hiring managers / internal recruiters of hiring companies. If they're interested in you at your asking salary, they'll reach out about an interview.

🤩 During my 2017 and 2022 job hunts, I received a total of 30 interview requests and landed two amazing dev roles. 

😭 During my 2023 job hunt, I've received exactly one interview request.

# [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)

💡 Tip: search for jobs at companies where you have a connection. The majority of interviews I've landed this round have come from connections.

If you're on LinkedIn, say hi! [Here's my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanjstark/).

# [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/jobs)

"A hiring platform for the climate workforce."
I attended their virtual job fair, which landed me two interviews.
They have a ton of remote roles listed.

# [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com/)

"Find engineering teams that share your values."
This one is not a huge job board, but it does have some brilliant functionality.

## [Homepage](https://www.keyvalues.com/)
You'll start by selecting the values that are most important to you in a work environment. Then, scroll down to find comanies with open roles that share your values.

## Culture Queries:
Start [here](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries). Once you've selected your values, scroll down and click "See results" to find excellent questions for _you_, the candidate, to ask the folk you're interviewing with.

A favorite of mine:
> Technical capabilities aside, what soft skills would make someone successful in this role?

# [SUNrise](https://projectsunrise.substack.com/)

A weekly newsletter tracking companies that have recently raised heaps of 💸 money, and are now hiring.
