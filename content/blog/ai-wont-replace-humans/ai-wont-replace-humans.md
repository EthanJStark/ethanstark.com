Around January 2023, as ChatGPT was blowing up, I was experiencing some existential dread: _At this rate, will software engineer roles even exist in a few years?_ ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜³

Since then, after voraciously learning and exploring these tools, and reading and listening to great minds discuss this topic, my prediction is:

_For a lot of fields, including software engineering, AI will not replace jobs wholesale. But human workers who can learn to wield these powerful new tools **will** replace those who don't._

Here are a few supporting opinions:
