Around January 2023, as ChatGPT was blowing up, I was experiencing some existential dread: _At this rate, will software engineer roles even exist in a few years?_ ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜³

Since then, after voraciously learning and exploring these tools, and reading and listening to great minds discuss this topic, my prediction is:

_For a lot of fields, including software engineering, AI will not replace jobs wholesale. But human workers who can learn to wield these powerful new tools **will** replace those who don't._

I say this while acknowledging that AI is aboslutely causing seismic shifts for many, many fields, including replacing jobs, and that I'm coming from a place of privilege that maybe, if I continue to learn to wield these tools, I'll be partially insulated. Also, I make this prediction with a healthy dose of humility: the rate of technological change is rapid and exponential, and who the heck knows what five years from now might look like.

On the [Hard Fork podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork), one of the hosts described the trend of newsrooms having fewer writers and more editors, and suggested that other industries, like SWE, might go in that direction: more devs acting like Engineering managers, supervising AI devs, assigning them tasks, reviewing their code.
