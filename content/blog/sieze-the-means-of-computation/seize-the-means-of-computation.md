Cory Doctorow is easily my favorite tech writer and activist. He's sharp, insightful, and extremeley entertaining.

He posits, and I tend to agree, that certain tech giants, including Facebook, Google, and Amazon, have followed a similar trajectory:

1. First, they are good to their users.
1. Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.
1. Finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.

He's coined a term for this lifecycle: **enshittification**. 

The Internet Con is a collection of essays that explore the problems of the modern internet and offer shovel-ready solutions.

I appreciate that he offers concrete actionable steps that are accessible today. One core theme is **interoperability**.

One of the core reasons users remain with, for example, Facebook, even as it becomes increasingly toxic, stuffed with ads and misinformation, is that their friends and family are there. So Facebook gets to benefit from network effects, a sort of momentum: it's hard to leave because everyone else is there.

This is where interoperability comes in. If you could use a different social network, but still interact with your friends on Facebook, you'd be more likely to leave.

Interoperability is available today, in the form of services backed by the [ActivityPub](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) protocol. There are a number of services that support it, including [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/). I've spent a fair amount of time on Mastodon, and it's been just lovely. In my own personal experience, zero ads, zero hate speech, and zero Nazis. More than you can say about Twitter/X. Sure, that stuff is definitely out there, but by joining well-moderated instances with good block-lists, I've been able to avoid it.

To get a taste of the book, you can enjoy Cory reading the first chapter of the audiobook as a DRM-free mp3 [here](https://craphound.com/internetcon/2023/08/01/the-internet-con-how-to-seize-the-means-of-computation-audiobook-outtake/)

He also gave a great talk at Defcon 31, where he spells out the core of his thesis [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rimtaSgGz_4?si=RUFSQBm_df34rnBy).
