**TL;DR**: 

* The KOSA bill is not an effective way to combat online abuse.
* It's a threat to the open web.
* It increases the surface area for our personal, sensitive data to be leaked.
* It puts marginalized groups like LGBTQ+ folk at risk. 
* [Write your representatives](https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids) to oppose the bill.

EFF says it better than I can. Here's their [excellent writeup](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/kids-online-safety-act-still-huge-danger-our-rights-online), and here's a [delightfully simple, pre-filled form](https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids) that lets you write your representatives. It took me literally 4 minutes.

## My Letter

While the EFF form linked above includes a perfectly servicable letter that you could just send, I thought I'd share my own variation here, written with the help of GPT-4. Feel free to use it as a template for your own letter.

> As your constituent, I urge you to reject and publicly oppose the Kids Online Safety Act. 

> While the fundamental intention of protecting children online is commendable, the ramifications of this bill extend far beyond its purported objective. By endorsing a sweeping measure like KOSA, we risk undermining the very essence of an open and free internet, which has been a beacon of knowledge, innovation, and democratic discourse.

> The bill's provision to compel online platforms to deploy age verification systems is particularly alarming. Such systems would not only infringe upon users' right to online anonymity but also create a reservoir of personal data ripe for misuse. This accentuates the risk of private entities, such as identity verification firms like Clear or ID.me, amassing unprecedented amounts of sensitive user data.

> Moreover, KOSA's design could inadvertently transform state attorneys general into de facto gatekeepers of online content. This has profound implications. If platforms, in their bid to comply with KOSA, preemptively censor content that could be deemed unsuitable by any of the 50 state attorneys general, it would lead to a homogenized, sanitized, and heavily redacted internet. Such broad discretionary powers might result in the loss of access to legitimate, educational, and crucial information simply because it doesn't align with the views of one state's leading legal official. This isn't protection—it's blatant censorship under the guise of safety.

> As we stand at this pivotal juncture, I implore you to prioritize the collective rights of internet users. The internet, in its vastness, offers a diverse range of perspectives, and it's imperative that we preserve its integrity. Please champion the cause of internet freedom and privacy, and publicly voice your opposition to KOSA.

> Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

> Sincerely,
> Ethan Stark
