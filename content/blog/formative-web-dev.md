Zach Leatherman, the brilliant creator of the static site generator 11ty (that's what [powers this site!](https://ethanstark.com/blog/eleventy-netlify/)), asked folk on Mastodon what blog posts were most influential to how you build for the web.

He then gathered the responses into a li'l micro-site (using 11ty, of course); makes for some good reading.
