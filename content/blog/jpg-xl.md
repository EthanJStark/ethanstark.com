The future of web image formats looks to be JPEG-XL! 60-70% smaller file sizes than jpg?! üòÆ

The JPEG-XL format was previously in trial by Chrome and Firefox, but was dropped in 2022. Apple, however, has added support in iOS17 and macOS Sonoma.

Gumlet, a CDN, also just added support, and wrote this lovely blog post about the format:
