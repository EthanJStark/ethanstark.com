The future of web image formats looks to be JPEG-XL! 60-70% smaller file sizes than jpg?! üòÆ

The JPEG-XL format was previously in trial by Chrome and Firefox, but was dropped in 2022. Apple, however, has added support in iOS17 and macOS Sonoma.

Gumlet, a CDN, also just added support, and wrote [this lovely blog post](https://www.gumlet.com/blog/jpeg-xl/) about the format.

## September 2024 Update

Apple [has incorperated](https://petapixel.com/2024/09/18/why-apple-uses-jpeg-xl-in-the-iphone-16-and-what-it-means-for-your-photos/) JPG XL into how the iPhone 16 Pro captures photos.
